# Telemarketing_Campaign_Response_SVM
This project involves building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a customer will respond positively to a telemarketing campaign. The model is trained on historical campaign data, including customer demographics, contact details, and previous interaction outcomes.

Key Features:
Input Data: Includes features such as age, job, marital status, education, previous campaign outcomes, and call duration.

Target Variable: Customer response (typically binary: 'yes' or 'no').

Algorithm: SVM â€“ chosen for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and binary classification.

Goal: Help marketing teams prioritize leads and optimize campaign effectiveness by predicting potential responders.
